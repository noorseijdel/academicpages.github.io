Welcome to my website! I am currently a postdoc in the [Communicative Brain group](https://www.mpi.nl/department/communicative-brain/21) at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, led by [Linda Drijvers](https://lindadrijvers.nl/).  In my research, I use computational models of visual processing (artificial neural networks, models of reading), neuroimaging and behavioral experiments. Apart from doing research. I am passionate about teaching and enjoy organizing events.
