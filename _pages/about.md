Welcome to my website~ I am currently a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, working together with Linda Drijvers.  In my research, I use computational models of visual processing (artificial neural networks, models of reading), neuroimaging and behavioral experiments. Apart from doing research. I am passionate about teaching and enjoy organizing events.
